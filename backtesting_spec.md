# Options Strategy Backtesting Framework Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the specification for a robust and flexible backtesting framework for options trading strategies. The framework will allow users to simulate the performance of their strategies against historical data to assess their viability and profitability before deploying them in a live market.

## 2. Core Components

The framework will consist of the following core components:

*   **Data Handler:** Responsible for ingesting, cleaning, and providing historical market data.
*   **Strategy Manager:** Allows users to define and manage their trading strategies.
*   **Execution Engine:** Simulates the execution of trades based on the strategy's logic.
*   **Portfolio Manager:** Tracks the portfolio's state, including positions, cash, and performance.
*   **Performance Analyzer:** Calculates and presents key performance metrics and visualizations.

## 3. Data Handling

### 3.1. Data Sources

The framework should support multiple data sources for historical options and equity data. This could include:

*   CSV files
*   Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
*   APIs from data providers (e.g., Polygon, Intrinio, CBOE)

### 3.2. Data Requirements

The framework will require the following historical data:

*   **Equity Data:** Daily and intraday (down to 1-minute resolution) OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for the underlying assets.
*   **Options Data:** Historical options chains for the underlying assets, including:
    *   Strike price
    *   Expiration date
    *   Option type (call/put)
    *   Bid and ask prices (for simulating realistic fills)
    *   Volume and open interest
    *   The Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho)

### 3.3. Data Preprocessing

The Data Handler will be responsible for:

*   Handling missing or erroneous data.
*   Adjusting for corporate actions (e.g., stock splits, dividends).
*   Aligning timestamps between different data sources.

### 3.4. Dynamic Symbol and Timeframe

The framework must allow users to specify:
*   **Symbol:** The stock ticker for which the backtest should be run (e.g., 'AAPL', 'GOOGL').
*   **Timeframe:** The start and end dates for the backtest period.

The Data Handler must be able to dynamically fetch the required data for the specified symbol and timeframe.

## 4. Strategy Definition

### 4.1. Strategy Representation

Strategies will be defined as Python classes that inherit from a base `Strategy` class. This will allow for a modular and reusable approach to strategy creation. Strategies should be designed to be independent of specific tickers or timeframes, allowing them to be tested on different instruments and historical periods without modification.

### 4.2. Strategy Logic

The `Strategy` class will provide methods for users to define their logic, such as:

*   `initialize()`: For setting up the strategy's parameters.
*   `on_data()`: The main event loop that is called for each new data point. This is where the trading logic will reside.

### 4.3. Supported Strategies

The framework should be flexible enough to support a wide range of options strategies, including but not limited to:

*   **Single-leg:** Long Call/Put, Short Call/Put
*   **Spreads:** Vertical, Horizontal, Diagonal
*   **Combinations:** Straddles, Strangles, Iron Condors, Butterflies

## 5. Execution Engine

### 5.1. Order Types

The Execution Engine will support various order types, including:

*   Market orders
*   Limit orders
*   Stop orders

### 5.2. Slippage and Commissions

To provide a more realistic simulation, the Execution Engine will model:

*   **Slippage:** The difference between the expected fill price and the actual fill price. This can be modeled as a fixed amount or a percentage of the spread.
*   **Commissions:** Trading fees can be configured as a fixed amount per trade or per contract.

## 6. Portfolio Management

The Portfolio Manager will be responsible for:

*   Tracking the current cash balance.
*   Maintaining a list of current positions.
*   Calculating the portfolio's market value at any given time.
*   Generating daily P&L statements.

## 7. Performance Analysis

### 7.1. Key Performance Metrics (KPIs)

The Performance Analyzer will calculate a comprehensive set of metrics, including:

*   **Overall Performance:**
    *   Total Return
    *   Annualized Return
    *   Sharpe Ratio
    *   Sortino Ratio
*   **Risk Metrics:**
    *   Max Drawdown
    *   Volatility
    *   Value at Risk (VaR)
*   **Trade-level Metrics:**
    *   Win/Loss Ratio
    *   Average Win/Loss
    *   Profit Factor

### 7.2. Visualizations

The framework will generate a variety of plots and charts to help users visualize the strategy's performance, such as:

*   Equity curve
*   Drawdown plot
*   P&L distribution
*   Rolling performance metrics

## 8. Technology Stack

*   **Language:** Python 3.x
*   **Libraries:**
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
    *   **Plotting:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
    *   **Numerical Computing:** SciPy

## 9. Future Enhancements

*   Integration with live trading platforms.
*   Support for more complex, multi-leg strategies.
*   Machine learning-based strategy optimization.
*   Web-based user interface for interacting with the framework.
